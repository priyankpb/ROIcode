Coding Exercise:
·         Write a program in Java that converts a sentence from English to Inflationary English. Inflationary English takes words and word parts that sound the same as a number (e.g. “won” v. “one”) and then inflates that to the next number (e.g. “won” becomes “two”). Provide tests for your program.
